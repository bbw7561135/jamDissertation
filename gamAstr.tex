gamma-ray production mechanisms

gamma-ray astronomy is really a proxy for studying cosmic rays and acceleration/diffusion processes. How much to get into CR. 

gamma-ray telescopes leads into the LAT, Egret was  predecessor , what it did and what were some relevant unanswered questions regarding supernova remnants 
    
Maybe combine the telescope stuff  with the LAT section and leave this section for history and astrophysics of \g-rays? Or just combine this section with  LAT section?
