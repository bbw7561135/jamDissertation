\section{Introduction}\label{gamAstr:intro}
Maybe this is not just gamma astro, but gamma astro of SNRS

The story of \gam 's from astrophysical objects is a tale of the most extreme, energetic, and violent environments in our universe. Discovered by Paul Villard studying radiation from radium and named by Ernest Rutherford, who previously uncovered the nature of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation, \gam's are the highest named energy of light 

more historical context instead of a separate section


what is a gamma-ray

why bother studying gamma-rays

probe of extreme environments



\section{\gam~Emission Mechanisms }\label{gamAstr:CR}
Gamma-rays as a probe of cosmic rays and cosmic acceleration processes

gamma-ray astronomy as  a proxy for studying cosmic rays and acceleration/diffusion processes. How much to get into CR. 

Cosmic particle accelerators and \gam's
accelerator plus target often 


What's a CR, quick,  general CR properties that are relevant to SNRs

why use gamma's  to study CR

gamma-ray production mechanisms

-Synch,
-Bremss,
-IC,
-pi0,

\section{Sources of \gam's}\label{gamAstr:Sources}
Maybe don't need this? The reason to is to say SNRs early on. Would I mention other sources to be complete?

SNRs as the primary source of Galactic CRs, order of mag (zwicky?) energy from 0.1*E SNR could account for energy in CRs in Galaxy

\section{\gam~Detection}\label{gamAstr:Detect}
Quick rehash of method of detecting \gam's? Or is this just about previous \gam ~detectors and the state of the \gam~sky pre-Fermi?  mention telescopes up to EGRET, bit of detail on EGRET and what the pre-Fermi \gam~sky looked like, in particular in the context of SNRs, PWN, Galactic plane

gamma-ray telescopes leads into the LAT, Egret was  predecessor , what it did and what were some relevant unanswered questions regarding supernova remnants

\section{Scratch}


Altho' many miles from bomb zero, Dr. Bruce Banner is bathed in the full force of the mysterious Gamma Rays!
