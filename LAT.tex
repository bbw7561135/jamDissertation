\chapter{The Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope}
\label{chap:LAT}
\section{Overview}
General info about Fermi, when it was conceived, launched, what questions it was designed to address etc.
\section{The Large Area Telescope}
Details on the LAT and it's design, be sure to focus on things that particularly pertain to the work I've done like what determines the PSF, thing about Pass 8 here maybe? Or maybe later on. 

what science was it designed to answer

general capabilities

details about aspect of the LAT related to extended sources, what determines PSF

Searching for extended Galactic sources leads into stellar remnants section?

Merged this with the LAT analysis  section

I'm not sure about this chapter yet. Maybe it's a general section on Analysis of Fermi data, why maximum likelihood, how it's formulated,  implemented in the Science Tools, pointlike and the analysis for extended sources. Diffuse emission

Four steps to going from observing the sky to final LAT analysis:

Instrument taking data: How we get to counts

Reconstruction : How we get photons

Likelihood: How to characterize sky using response functions, point source  and diffuse modeling

Likelihood for ES: how to use likelihood methods to char and resolve sources measure  extension
