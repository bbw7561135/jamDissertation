\chapter{SNR-MC, 10 GeV, and anything else?}
\label{chap:other}

Not sure how this is going to factor in yet. \gls{SNRMC} should fit in somehow since a good deal of work was done? Less certain about 10gev. 

Maybe this should say something about how the work I've done has contributed to the field of knowledge but also can lead to future work?
