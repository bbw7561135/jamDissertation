\section{Goooo $\gamma$-rays go!}

In this thesis we...or should I start with the extreme environs line?

Overview of the entire thesis, why gamma-rays, why the \lat, why \snr and \pwn and extended sources.

Higher energy studies with the LAT have been my focus since the beginning. Talk about what's nice about staying above 1 GeV, 10 GeV, 50 GeV. 

GeV TeV connection for 2FHL

Radio GeV for SNR cat (traces same particle population)

The advent of the \lat presents for the first time the capability to spectrally and spatially resolve \gls{snr} at \gev energies.

it is uniquely situated to address these issues

egret was mostly pointed observation instrumented that would sometimes dwell on a spot for a couple of weeks, had a smaller field o view, didn't get as many photons (the LAT saw the entire EGRET sky in some short amount of time)

\snrs as sources of relativistic particles

Despite being the prime energy range to observe the effects of cosmic particle acceleration, the photon \sed{} resulting from these overlapping emission channels are often difficult to spectrally distinguish from one another. \jamie{what's the point of this last sentence here? maybe no need to mention this now, i really just want to motivate GeV energies}
