This thesis consists of 8 chapters including an introduction, conclusion, and three background chapters on supernova remnants, \gam{} emission theory and detection methods, and a description of the relevant aspects of the \Fermi{} Gamma Ray Space Telescope.

Chapters \ref{chap:snrcat} and  \ref{chap:2FHL} are, respectively, taken in part from ``The First \Fermi{}-LAT Supernova Remnant Catalog''and ``'2FHL: The Second Catalog of Hard Fermi-LAT Sources'', both published in \emph{The Astrophysical Journal Supplement} in 2016. Both papers are large, catalog studies involving the entire LAT collaboration. The parts of those papers included in this dissertation are the those in which I directly contributed to via analysis, writing, discussion. The text in Chapters \ref{chap:snrcat} and \ref{chap:2FHL} also expands on the work I did for those papers, and provides further detail on analysis not included in the papers.

Chapter \ref{chap:G150} is the contents of a paper currently in preparation. The title of this paper is to be ``\FermiLat{} Observations of Extended Gamma-Ray Emission in the Direction of SNR G150.3+4.5'' (Cohen et al. 2016). The paper is included in entirety in this thesis, including additional supplementary material not to be included in the journal article.
