\chapter{Gamma-ray Astronomy}
\label{chap:gamAstr}

The story of \gam 's from astrophysical objects is a tale of the most extreme, energetic, and violent environments in our universe. Discovered by Paul Villard studying radiation from radium and named by Ernest Rutherford, who previously uncovered the nature of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation, \gam's are the highest named energy of light (this counts as common knowledge right? or do I ref wiki?)

gamma-ray production mechanisms

gamma-ray astronomy is really a proxy for studying cosmic rays and acceleration/diffusion processes. How much to get into CR. 

gamma-ray telescopes leads into the LAT, Egret was  predecessor , what it did and what were some relevant unanswered questions regarding supernova remnants 
    
Maybe combine the telescope stuff  with the LAT section and leave this section for history and astrophysics of \g-rays? Or just combine this section with  LAT section?

Altho' many miles from bomb zero, Dr. Bruce Banner is bathed in the full force of the mysterious Gamma Rays!
