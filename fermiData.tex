\chapter{Analysis of \lat- data}
\label{chap:fermiData}
I'm not sure about this chapter yet. Maybe it's a general section on Analysis of Fermi data, why maximum likelihood, how it's formulated,  implemented in the Science Tools, pointlike and the analysis for extended sources. Diffuse emission

Four steps to going from observing the sky to final LAT analysis:

Instrument taking data: How we get to counts

Reconstruction : How we get photons

Likelihood: How to characterize sky using response functions, point source  and diffuse modeling

Likelihood for ES: how to use likelihood methods to char and resolve sources measure  extension
