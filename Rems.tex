\chapter{Stellar Remnants}
\label{chap:Rems}
Is it weird to call them stellar remnants? It's not like the remnant of the star, but of the supernova
\section{Supernova Remnants}
History of SNR,  radio detections, then x-ray, can't really ID in new ones with the LAT, theory: snow plow , ST evolution, radiative phase, shell type, mixed morphology (shell plus center filled thermal x-ray) 
\section{Pulsar Wind Nebulae}
How much of my thesis is really about pwn? in 2FHL we detect some. if including above 10gev work, they'll be there too. Much of the thesis is really about extended gamma-ray sources, but not sure how that fits into the title and chapters yet

Do I need to get into composite SNRs (I think composite means SNR + PWN right?) Maybe relevant for G150? Some things about interaction of reverse shock with PWN and crushing/reverberations of the PWN?

How we detect gamma-rays from SNRs/PWNe in the Galaxy leads to and analysis section maybe?
