\chapter{SNR G150.3+4.5}
\label{chap:G150}
Dedicated analysis  of one interesting \gls{2FHL} result. First blindly detected extended \g -ray source. Large size  + HI suggest it's near, hard spectrum looks like pwn, but size matches with radio SNR.

Take this all straight from the paper I write.


\section{\label{G150:summ}Summary} \jamie{most of this should be the conclusions from the G150 paper}In this chapter, we have presented the publication on the dedicated analysis of the extended \g -ray emission detected in the direction of \gone. \gone ~was first detected in radio by \cite{Gao14}, and subsequently detected in \g-rays in \gls{2FHL} above 50 \gev. We discussed our \gls{LAT} morphological analysis at energies E $\geq$ x \gev~and spectral analysis down to E $\geq$ 750 \mev, demonstrating a change in extension and centroid position compared to the \gls{2FHL} result. Discuss potential source origin scenarios. Is it SNR or PWN? Is \gls{2FHL} source same as $>$ few \gev? 

\jamie{for diss, not paper}. The way this figures into the whole is that  this is a follow up analysis of one of the most interesting  sources detected with addSrcs, and, (hopefully!), we're able to say something about the source and nature of the \g-ray emission, relation to SNR and \gls{2FHL} source1
